# Bahaviour-Analysis-Project

The idea of this project came from the Python specialisation course I was working on, and my past experience with location analysis. I was trying to put together all the various skills I was learning and make them into something interesting.

During my learning experience I used Twint to scape twitter data, and then a mash up of Geeks for Geeks, machinelearningmastery.com, analystics vidhaya, and whatever else I could find to put together an analysis. 

I had intended on taking this analysis further, just for fun... but havent had the time.
